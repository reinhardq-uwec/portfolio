        <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Quinn Reinhard.</p><p>I have a passion for cooking, illustration, music, and travel. I just returned from a semester abroad in Stirling, Scotland. I'm currently attending the Universite of Wisconsin-Eau Claire with a major in Graphic Communications and a Minor in Creative Writing. I've previously held positions with Jostens in diploma production, material packing, and the input of rep back order information.</p>
        <p>I enjoy cultivating creative hobbies. I don't enjoy not being instantly proficient at things, but I love being able to observe my progress in the development of skills. Over quarantine, I picked up crocheting, practicing daily until I reached a level I was proud of. I eventually opened an Etsy shop, where I sell crocheted hats.</p>
        <p>My professional goals are to embrace creativity, find a sense of community within a professional team, challenge myself with new undertakings, and foster new skills.</p><br><br>
